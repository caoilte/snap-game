We recommend you spend no more than 2 hours on this. Feel free to get it back to us however you like (GitHub, email, ...) within one week from receiving the test.

The assignment is as follows:

We would like you to write a command line app in Scala using standard libraries. If there is another dependency you wish to pull in that makes part of the task significantly easier then that is fine. 
The problem is deliberately not too complex - what we are looking for is how you approach the problem, structure your code etc.

The task is to simulate a game of snap between two players using standard playing card decks.

Requirements

* The application should ask the user how many playing card decks to play with
* The application should ask the user whether cards should be matched: on suit, value or both
* The application should shuffle the decks before play commences
* Games of snap should then be simulated between two computer players. Cards are played one at a time and when two matching cards are dealt one after another the first player to 'shout' snap wins (include some randomness)
* The winner of each round collects all the cards dealt in this round
* Once all cards are exhausted the application should declare the winner based on who has the most won cards
